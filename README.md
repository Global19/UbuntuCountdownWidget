# Ubuntu Countdown Widget

Keep an eye on the days remaining before the new Ubuntu release!

## Features
* Two square widgets (1x1 and 2x2)
* Ability to set a custom date
* Built with an eye on battery consumption (widget refresh at most twice a day)

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank all of those who directly or indirectly contributed to the creation of this software.

In particular, thanks to:

* Martín Césare for creating all the software graphics.
* Canonical for creating this wonderful GNU/Linux distribution.

## FOSS friendly!
All the proprietary libraries are wrapped and the app can be build without any binary blob using the `foss` flavour.
